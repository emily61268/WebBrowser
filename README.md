# WebBrowser - Qroxx
As one of my course projects, I successfully developed a three-tier, graphical, event-driven desktop application, a web browser, which I named it Qroxx, using Visual Studio and an object-oriented language (C#) while incorporating essential software construction methodologies. The browser has basic functionality, such as going to the previous/next page, refreshing a page, bookmarking a page, etc.
